    "## Apache Airflow\n",
    "Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used to create, schedule, and manage workflows (often called DAGs—Directed Acyclic Graphs). It’s commonly used for data engineering, ETL/ELT processes, machine-learning pipelines, and other tasks that need automation\n",
    "\n",
    "A tool that runs your Python jobs, ETL jobs, and data workflows on a schedule, with full visibility and control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Workflow as code: You define workflows in Python, making them version-controlled, testable, and flexible.\n",
    "    2. DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): A workflow is expressed as tasks with upstream/downstream dependencies.\n",
    "    3. Scheduler: Airflow schedules your tasks based on defined intervals or triggers.\n",
    "    4. Executor: Runs tasks on different backends (Local, Celery, Kubernetes, etc.).\n",
    "    5. UI: A web interface to monitor, trigger, and debug workflows.\n",
    "    6. Extensibility: Large ecosystem of operators and hooks for systems like AWS, GCP, databases, Spark, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Airflow?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. I need this script to run at 3 AM every day.\n",
    "    2. Task B should run only after Task A is finished.\n",
    "    3. I want retries, alerts, logging.\n",
    "    4. I want a UI to see what’s running, failed, succeeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Airflow is widely used in:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Data Engineering\n",
    "    2. ML Pipelines\n",
    "    3. ETL/ELT\n",
    "    4. Analytics Workflow\n",
    "    5. Cloud Automation etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)\n",
    "        A Python file that defines:\n",
    "            - tasks\n",
    "            - dependencies\n",
    "            - schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Task\n",
    "        A single step in your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Operator\n",
    "        A pre-built template for a task:\n",
    "            - PythonOperator\n",
    "            - BashOperator\n",
    "            - EmailOperator\n",
    "            - SQL operators\n",
    "            - Sensor (waits for something)\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Scheduler\n",
    "        Watches the schedule and triggers DAG runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Executor\n",
    "        Determines how tasks run\n",
    "            - LocalExecutor\n",
    "            - CeleryExecutor\n",
    "            - KubernetesExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Airflow UI\n",
    "        Dashboard to see DAGs, logs, task runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines a DAG with two tasks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# install necessary libraries:\n",
    "from airflow import DAG\n",
    "from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "# define the dag:\n",
    "with DAG(\n",
    "    dag_id=\"example_dag\",\n",
    "    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),\n",
    "    schedule=\"@daily\"\n",
    "):\n",
    "    task1 = BashOperator(\n",
    "        task_id=\"say_hello\",\n",
    "        bash_command=\"echo hello\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "    task2 = BashOperator(\n",
    "        task_id=\"say_bye\",\n",
    "        bash_command=\"echo bye\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",

    "## Apache Airflow Setup (PyPI Installation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1:\n",
